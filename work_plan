Title:
  Neural audio synthesis built on pyo engine

Description:
  This projet focuses on bridging the gap between the pyo library for sound generation and manipulation, and the
  Google Magenta framework, as well as exploring the creative possibilities of neural audio synthesis through 
  pyo.
  
 Needs:
  - Provide wrapper functions (API) to send information from pyo directly to Magenta neural networks.
  - Use the signal processing capabilities of pyo to generate interesting sounds with Magenta.
  - Provide an interface to make this form of audio synthesis more accessible to musicians. 
  
 Knowledge:
  - Become familiar with the architecture behind neural networks used for audio synthesis (such as Wavenet).
  - Understand the Magenta code and the type of input format to be sent from pyo.
  - Learn to create an interface that streamlines the interaction process between pyo and Magenta (text-based or
  graphical interface?)
  
  Model:
    Neural audio synthesis essentially tries to fulfill the goal of learning the makeup of different classes of sounds
    and generate new ones from this acquired knowledge.
